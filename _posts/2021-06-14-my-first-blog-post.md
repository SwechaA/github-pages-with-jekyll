As a highschooler, my interests stretch across volunteering, music, sports, and creative hobbies. 
I raised over 1,000 books for a library in developing countries, raised $500 for a COVID-19 charity fund by tutoring elementary/middle schoolers, and taught English to an orphanage in India.
I also play tennis, in solo tournaments and for the school team, and I play the piano for recitals and competitions.
My love of writing has led me to write articles, books, and poetry, some of which is published.
I also enjoy working in STEM, and I have been in Math Club and Science Olympiad for multiple years.
